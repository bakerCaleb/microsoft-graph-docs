# accessReviewScheduleDefinition resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

Represents the scheduling of an Azure AD [access review](accessreviewsv2-root.md). 

An accessReviewScheduleDefinition contains a list of [accessReviewInstance](accessreviewinstance.md) objects. Each recurrence of the schedule definition creates an instance. Instances also represent each unique resource being reviewed. If a schedule definition reviews multiple resources (including multiple groups), each resource has a unique instance per each recurrence. In the case of a one-time review, only one instance is created per resource.

| createdBy  |[userIdentity](../resources/useridentity.md)  | User who created this review. |
| scope  |[accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md)  | Defines scope of resources to review. For supported scopes, see [accessReviewScope](accessreviewscope.md). Required on create. Supports `$select` and `$filter` (`contains` only). For examples of options for configuring scope, see [Configure the scope of your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-scope-concept).|
| instanceEnumerationScope|[accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md)  | This property is required when scoping a review to guest users' access across all Microsoft 365 groups and determines which Microsoft 365 groups are reviewed. Each group will become a unique **accessReviewInstance** of the access review series.  For supported scopes, see [accessReviewScope](accessreviewscope.md). Supports `$select`. For examples of options for configuring instanceEnumerationScope, see [Configure the scope of your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-scope-concept).| 
| settings  |[accessReviewScheduleSettings](../resources/accessreviewschedulesettings.md)| The settings for an access review series, see type definition below. Supports `$select`.|
| reviewers   |[accessReviewReviewerScope](../resources/accessreviewreviewerscope.md) collection| This collection of access review scopes is used to define who are the reviewers. Required on create. Supports `$select`. For examples of options for assigning reviewers, see [Assign reviewers to your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-scope-concept).|
| backupReviewers   |[accessReviewReviewerScope](../resources/accessreviewreviewerscope.md) collection| This collection of reviewer scopes is used to define the list of fallback reviewers. These fallback reviewers will be notified to take action if no users are found from the list of reviewers specified. This could occur when either the group owner is specified as the reviewer but the group owner does not exist, or manager is specified as reviewer but a user's manager does not exist. Supports `$select`. <br>**Note:** This property has been replaced by **fallbackReviewers**. However, specifying either **backupReviewers** or **fallbackReviewers** automatically populates the same values to the other property.|
| fallbackReviewers   |[accessReviewReviewerScope](../resources/accessreviewreviewerscope.md) collection| This collection of reviewer scopes is used to define the list of fallback reviewers. These fallback reviewers will be notified to take action if no users are found from the list of reviewers specified. This could occur when either the group owner is specified as the reviewer but the group owner does not exist, or manager is specified as reviewer but a user's manager does not exist. Supports `$select`.|
| instances |[accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md) collection|  Set of access reviews instances for this access review series. Access reviews that do not recur will only have one instance; otherwise, there is an instance for each recurrence. |

## Relationships

| Relationship | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| `instances`               |[accessReviewInstance](accessreviewinstance.md) collection         | If the `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` is a recurring access review, instances represent each recurrence.
